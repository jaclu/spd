# Simple Posix Deploy

Deploying in place for simple Posix environs, where ansible and similar more advanced tools do not make much sense
and where in placs deployment is the logical aproach.



restoree-ish has two primary usage cases
1) To restore a fresh install into your prefeed state

2) To reset
  - installed software
  - services
  - /root dir
  - home dir
  
  Into a fresh state, it is not fully indempotent, since some tasks will be redone, but it is in the sense that repeated runs wont alter anything unless config changes requests so.

## Filestructure
### /bin 
The main apps included in this repo.
### /scripts
The modules used by restore-ish, offered in a way to make them useable in a standalone fashion.
### /files
This is where I store some files to deploy, depending on your config
  - inittab-default-FS -> /etc/inittab
  - repositories -> /etc/apk/repositories
### /initial-apks
Every now and then I update theese, always check the date to see if it is fresh enough to be usefull for you.
This directory contains lists of all apks installed out of the box generated by apk-leaves.
This way its simple to see what is needed to get all your stuff, and what you might want to remove in your restore procedure.
### /samples
This is a subset of my extra_tasks, with any more private items filtered out :) Mostly to give you a general idea of how I use it.
### /custom
Ignored by the repo, suggested location for your own local files
### /custom/config
This is a hardcoded path. All other files you refer to in this file, so you can decide a good location for them if /custom does not fit your needs. Remember to store anything outside the local filesystem, in order for it to be available for other devices or after a reinstall.


## Available tools
### bin/apk-leaves
Displays all leave apks, ie apks that no other apks depend upon. In order to recreate a software deploy all you need to know are the leave nodes. Install them and you will have replicated your env.

Should be fully generic, uses ash shell so should work on a fresh deploy.
Would probably run on any Alpine system, but I havent tried.

Run with -h param to see options.

### bin/restore-ish
Restores an iSH env to include your prefered default state, mostly idempotent, so can be run repeatedly. For instance if you change a param, one of the tarballs it uses etc. Very convenient if you have multiple iSH devices to set them up to be in sync.

See the header of the file for latest changes.

Params and settings:
The sample/ishTools.cfg explains all params. copy this file to 
custom/ishTools.cfg, then it will not be touched if you update the repo.

Actions taken, deppending on your config:
- Recognizes if this is a default or a AOK filesystem.
- If AOK FS
  - corrects a file priv
- Copies a few files into /etc
  - If default FS 
    - an /etc/inittab without unused gettys
  - can replace /etc/hosts, so it can connect to any of your local devices by name if you dont have local DNS setup.
  - can replace /etc/apk/repositories, defaul is to use Alpine v3.12  
- Does apk update and apk upgrade for latest updates
- can set time_zone
- Can add any apks you expect to be installed
- Can remove any apks you do not want to be installed
- Can deploy ssh hostkeys if prepaed for this device.
  This is a huge timesaver if you ssh into it, since otherwise after each re-install your other machines will complain that the hostkeys have changed.
- Can ignore, set up or disable sshd, will install what is needed for sshd to run, even if you do not indicate sshd to be activated, so that you can more conveniently activate it manually later.
- Creates a no password sudo group
- If you have defined a root environ and request it to be installed, will untar it into place
- If you have defined a username, creates it, adds it to the no-password group
- If you have saved a user environ and request it to be installed, will untar it into place
- If an extra task has been defined, run it. 
  I use this to be have my private configs outside of this repo. I have included a sample, to give you an idea.
- If a user was created and no password is yet defined, prints a reminder to set that users password, since otherwise you will not be able to ssh into the box.

## Scripts
I have split up restore-ish into separate modules, so that some parts of it can be run separatedly
You can run the individual scripts with a -h param to get a summary of what it offers, and what environment variables it relies on.
Below is a list of what is propably the parts that are most usefull as standalones.

### task_timezone
Sets time-zone, also installing all needed tools
  
### task_location_tracker
Sets up a location_tracker service, this keeps ish running in the background right from bootup, avoiding the need for having to login to get this functionality through the login scripts.

### task_sshd
Does all needed to set up a sshd service

### task_etc_files
Deploys a custom /etc/hosts for all your non dns hosts. Deploys /etc/apk/repositories of your choosing

### task_restore_root_home
Populates /root from a tgz, optionally moving previous /root to /root-OLD

### tasks_restore_user
Creates a user, adds it to the no passwd sudo group, sets/changes shell, optionally populates home-dir from a tgz

### task_sudo
Adds a no password sudo group


## Procedure to restore your environment
I deploy this to iCloud, this way I can use it on any of my devices
My procedure on a pristine iSH system (as root)
- mount -t ios . /mnt (or any other local path)
  - Chose where this is located on your tablet / phone
- /mnt/bin/restore-ish, takes one to a couple of minutes, depending on how many apks you install.
  - If user was defined, displays a reminder to set the user password if it has not been set yet.
- Set the user password if requested to do so, following the instructions.
- Usage once restore-ish is completed.
  - default FS
    - For local access, just do su - {your username}
  - AOK FS
    - For local access just exit the current session and login as {username} with or without password, depending on if one was set.
  - Common for both
    - For ssh access, asuming you have activated sshd, as soon as "sshd listening on port: xx" is displayed, you can login using the displayed port and as long as the used account has a password set.

## sshd related things to be aware of

Remember that even if you login using pubkeys, you still need to define a password, since by default sshd does not allow logins to passwordless accounts.

For both filesystems it will take a little while for ssshd to be started after a reboot. On my iPad 5th gen, its arround 10-15s but depending on device that will differ. Pretty soon you will have a feeling for how long you need to wait. If you try to early you will be rejected "Connection refused", so you can always repeatedly try to login until it succeeds, with no negative impact.
