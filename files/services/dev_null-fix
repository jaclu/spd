# This service is intended to recreate /dev/null during bootup,
# since it sometimes gets messed up, and recreating it should
# be harmless in case it was still in a good state.
# It should just be run as a one off rather than a service,
# but I havent yet figured out how to do this in the iSH environ.
# Not even @reboot /usr/local/sbin/dev_null-fix
# works as intended.
#
# So for the time being, running it as a boot time service 
# does the trick, even if not as elegant as it could be.
#
# In order for it to run on the next bootup, it reports
# that the startup failed. This prints out an error,
# however since it is not displayed during bootup, 
# that error is not really a bother to the user.
# If you run it manually, just know that the error is
# expected and not signifying that this failed.
#

#
# Use this to add it as a service
#
# rc-update add /etc/init.d/dev_null-fix sysinit
