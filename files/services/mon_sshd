#  This service monitors that sshd is responsive.
#  Side bonus, at least on my iPad is that sshd more often than not fails to
#  come up during boot, this will restart it in such cases.
#  If no prompt is seen, stops the service, kills the daemon process if it
#  is still running, then starts the service again.
#  Tweak polling intervall and logging in the sshd_monitor command.
