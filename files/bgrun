# This service reads the GPS and discards the output to /dev/null.

# is that this is the only way to ensure an iOS program continues to run
# in the background.
# This process has no noticeable impact on battery life.

# The above is all that is needed to have cat /dev/location > /dev/null

# The below parts are just adding some additional sanity, not needed
# in order for the daemon to woek by itself.
#
# Pointless to have more than one thing doing this. 
# The below aborts with error if:  cat /dev/location
# is already running.
# And displays warning if other processes are detected
# after stoping.
