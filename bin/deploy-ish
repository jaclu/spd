# Dependency: This shell script expects a config file to be present at
# ../custom/ishTols.cfg
# There is a sample config file in ../samples/ishTols.cfg copy it into the
# above location and modify it to match your preferences before running.
#
# When you run this all actions that will be done based on your config will
# be displayed, and then this app holds for 5 seconds. You can
# press Ctrl-C if you want to examine what will be done in more detail.
#
# This is a turn-key setup of a fresh iSH into a usable state
# Even if you do not have any homedirs to restore, this can be used to
# set the general environment up to your likings look at the settings bellow,
# anything that you do now want to bother with,
# just comment that  out.
#
# Works both on AppStore and TestFlight iSH
# and both with default and AOK filesystems
#
# Most output lines are kept short, in order to as much as possible
# display without line breaks on the iPhone.
#
# Copy it outside the iSH filesystem in order for it to survive a
# delete - install cycle. I use: mount -t ios . /mnt
# and then select a dir on iCloud, so I can get all my various devices
# restored from the same source. But im sure there are other ways to do it.
#
# Any feedback / bug reports welcome!
